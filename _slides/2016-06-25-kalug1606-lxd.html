# Outline

1. Don't wait to upgrade to Ubuntu 16.04
2. ZFS
3. Some backgroud of Virtualization and Containers
4. Features of LXC 2.0
5. demo (LXD + XFS)

# Don't wait to upgrade to Ubuntu LTS 16.04 (Xenial)

- Main Reason

 - It is Long Term Support (3 years for Desktop, 5 years for Server)

- My favorite reasons

 - LXD - Linux container hypervisor
 - ZFS - file system + logical volume manager 
 - snap/snappy - container-style packages for cross-distributions
 - juju 2.0 (still beta now) - support LXD provider

- What we still wait for

 - Unity8 + Mir (preinstalled in Yakkety 16.10)
 - [snap support in LXD](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/snapcraft/2016-June/000139.html)

# ZFS - file system + logical volume manager

- Before you start:
 - Don't worry about disk partions layout, ZFS support file based pool
 - for root on ZFS, you need more [steps](https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/wiki/Ubuntu-16.04-Root-on-ZFS)
- suggested hardware requirements
 - ECC memory. This isn't really a requirement, but it's highly recommended.
 - 8GB+ of memory for the best performance. It's perfectly possible to run with 2GB or less (and people do), but you'll need more if using deduplication.
- under the CDDL and MPL. [Ubuntu and ZFS: Possibly Illegal, Definitely Exciting](http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2016/03/10/ubuntu-zfs/), [ZFS Licensing and Linux](https://insights.ubuntu.com/2016/02/18/zfs-licensing-and-linux/)

# Killer features for container:
- snapshots
- copy-on-write cloning
- continuous integrity checking against data corruption
- automatic repair
- efficient data compression

---

# ZFS History

- 2005 - Sun Solaris (now owned by Oracle)
- 2007 - [ZFS committed to the FreeBSD base](http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-current/2007-April/070544.html), [ZFS on FreeBSD: A Quick Tutorial](http://coscup.org/2007/Slides/BSD_zfs.pdf)
- 2010 - Oracle stoped released, forked OpenZFS
- 2010 - ZFS on Linux (Native ZFS on Linux, not fusefs), is funded by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
- 2016 - Ubuntu, first distribution build-in

---
# ZoL Main components:
- SPA (Storage Pool Allocator)
- DMU (Data Management Unit)
- ZVOL (the block devices)
- ZPL layers (ZFS POSIX Layer)

- Reference slide: [ZFS Features & Concepts TOI](http://wiki.lustre.org/images/4/49/Beijing-2010.2-ZFS_overview_3.1_Dilger.pdf)
---

# Useful ZFS commands

- Install ZFS utils

        # apt install zfsutils-linux

- Create pool

        # zpool create pool-abc /dev/sda /dev/sdb1
        # truncate -s 2G file1
        # zpool create pool-abc /ABSPATH/file1

- Status

        # zpool status
        # zfs list

---
# Virtualization Background
- OS virtualization - containers (chroot, vserver, openvz, lxc/lxd)
- Para-Virtualization - hypervisor (xen), need hardware support
- Full-Virtualization (kvm, virtualbox)

---
# OS virtualization or isolation

- chroot - File system isolation
- kernel userspace - [PID, mount, user, network, UTS, IPC isolation](http://lwn.net/Articles/531114/)
- cgroup - CPU / Memory / disk I/O isolation
- Seccomp - stands for secure computing mode, allow limited 

        # grep Seccomp /proc/self/status

- lxc exec demo

        # grep Seccomp /proc/self/status

- AppArmor - Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system which is a kernel (LSM) enhancement to confine programs to a limited set of resources.

---
# Docker - Application Container
- Pros
 - a large image repository (public/private pool)
 - an API with a root daemon
 - networking handle 
- Cons
 - Poor image repository security - you don’t know what you run (being worked on)
 - Poor container isolation (being worked on)
 - Hard to debug
 - Always running, mandatory root daemon (by design)

- refer: [Containers, systemd-nspawn and overlayfs](https://www.insecure.ws/linux/systemd_nspawn.html#systemd-docker-lxc-etc)
---
# LXD
- isn't
 - another virtualization technoloy
 - fork of LXC
 - application container manager

- [LXD](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/sites/events/files/slides/ContainerCon%202015-%20LXD%20%26%20OpenStack.pdf) is
 - is a container "hypervisor" and a new user experience for LXC.
 - Specifically, it's made of three components:
  A system-wide daemon (lxd)
  A command line client (lxc)
  An OpenStack Nova plugin (nova-compute-lxd)
 - unprivileged by default
- [The LXD 2.0 Story](http://insights.ubuntu.com/2016/03/14/the-lxd-2-0-story-prologue/)

# Storage Backend

- [Backends](https://github.com/lxc/lxd/blob/master/doc/storage-backends.md)
 - Directory
 - Btrfs
 - LVM
 - ZFS
- Support for online snapshotting, including running state with Checkpoint/Restore in User (CRIU)
- Live migration support

- Config by init

        # lxd init

---
# Image and image pools
- Image based workflow (no more locally built rootfs)
- Tightly integrated with remote image services
 - https://images.linuxcontainers.org/
- image import/export
- image alais

---
# UI imporve and REST API

- [Data store in sqlite](https://github.com/lxc/lxd/blob/master/doc/database.md)
- [LXD and OpenStack](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/sites/events/files/slides/ContainerCon%202015-%20LXD%20%26%20OpenStack.pdf)
 - containers > snapshots
 - images > aliases
 - certificates
 - operations
 - networks
 - volumes
 - profiles
 - events
- Improve Shell command control
 - example list
  lxc list --fast
  lxc list
  lxc list --format json

---
# profile / config

- replace lxc template
- allow mulit-profiles
- limit cpu / memory
- config device
- use [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to handles early initialization of a cloud instance
 apt / user / ...

---
# Interacting with remote hosts
- LXD 1.0 API: That’s the REST API used between the clients and a LXD daemon as well as between LXD daemons when copying/moving images and containers.
- Simplestreams: The Simplestreams protocol is a read-only, image-only protocol used by both the LXD client and daemon to get image information and import images from some public image servers (like the Ubuntu images).

 $ lxc remote add foo 1.2.3.4
- more exciting: container migration move and copy
- You still need setup iptable for [port forwarding](https://github.com/sebgrohn/lxd-portforward)
